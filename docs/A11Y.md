# Accessibility Baseline

## Required
- Keyboard navigable interactive elements.
- Visible focus state (`focus-ring`).
- No hover-only critical interactions.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Body text at least 16px.

## Contrast
- Primary text/background should pass AA.
- Muted text only for secondary content.
- Do not rely on color alone for meaning.

## Controls
- Icon-only buttons require `aria-label`.
- Form fields must have labels.
- Error states must include text, not only color.
